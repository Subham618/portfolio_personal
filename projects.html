                    Refreshments are a must after a tiring and intense game or workout.
                    I plan to set up a new juice and fruit center near Old SAC to make healthy refreshments readily
                    available
                    near the Sports Complex instead of students having to go all the way back to their hostels.

                    Losing a Library Token carries with it a heavy fine of 1000 Rs. Replacing the current token system with a
                    digital ID scanning system that records a studentâ€™s details and the corresponding baggage shelf number will
                    eliminate the consequences of accidentally losing the token.

                    Hostel boarders are often unaware of exactly where their hostel's HMC has used funds received from the
HAB. Making all hostel transactions public to hostel boarders by the HMC will provide much-needed
transparency in the system's working and will allow for checks against corruption

                    IITG Buses and trucks often overspeed on narrow and crowded lanes, posing a huge threat to vulnerable
                    cyclists and pedestrians.
                    Enforcing a speed limit will aid in making the campus roads safer for everyone.

                    Plastic waste is often found near lakes and tea stalls. Organizing regular cleanliness drives with the help of
                    the student community will aid in the systematic cleaning of several heavily littered areas on campus.

                    Although almost all students generally commute using cycles, E-Rickshaws become an extremely
convenient mode of transport when one falls sick. These will also aid commute in the rainy season and for
campus visitors
